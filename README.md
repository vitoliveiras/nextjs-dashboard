## Chapter 1: Getting Started

### Creating a new project

*Recommendation: using pnpm (faster and more efficient than npm or yarn)*

1. Installing pnpm:
```
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Creating a Next.js app
```
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm
```

This command uses create-next-app, a CLI tool that sets up a Next.js application for you. In the command above, you're also using the *--example* flag with the starter examplo for this course.

### Understanding the basic structure of the Next.js app

- **/app**: Contains all the routes, components and logic for you application, this is where you'll be mostly working from
- **/app/lib**: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions
- **/app/ui**: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these componenets for you
- **/public**: Contains al  the static assets for your application, such images
- **Config Files**: You'll also notice config files such as *next.config.ts* at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using *create-next-app*. You'll not need to modify them in this course.

### Running the development server

1. Install the project's package
```
pnpm i
```

2. Start the development server
```
pnpm dev
```

## Chapter 2: CSS Styling

### Understanding Tailwind

*Tailwind is a CSS framework that speeds up development process by allowing you to quickly write utility classes directly in your React code.*

In Tailwind, you style elements by adding class names. For example, adding *text-blue-500* will turn the *h1* text blue.

### Understanding CSS Modules
*CSS Modules allow you to scope CSS to a componenet by automatically creating unique class name, so you don't have to worry about style collisions as well.*

1. Creating the CSS Module
```
<component-name>.module.css
.css-module-class-name {
    // style here
}
```

2. Using the CSS Module in the component (importing styles is mandatory)
```
<div className={styles.css-module-class-name}>
```

### Understanding clsx library
*clsx is a library that lets you toggle class names easily.*

For example:
- Suppose that you want to create an *InvoiceStatus* component which accepts *status*. The status can be 'pending' or 'paid'.
- If it's 'paid', you want the color to be green. If it's 'pending', you want the color to be gray.

Using clsx, it is possible to conditionally aplly the classes, like this:
```javascript
import clsx from 'clsx';
 
export default function InvoiceStatus({ status }: { status: string }) {
  return (
    <span
      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',
        {
          'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',
          'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',
        },
      )}
    >
    // ...
)}
```

## Chapter 3: Optimizing Fonts and Images

### Understanding next/font
*When using next/font module, Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the application, because it downloads font files at build time and hosts them with your other static assets (this means when a user visits your application, there are no additional newtwork requests for fonts).*

### Adding fonts to application
Creating *fonts.ts* file at the */app/ui* folder. Later, import and export the fonts to be used in the application, like this:
```
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
 
export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```
Now, the Inter font can be imported and used at any component.

### Uderstanding Image component
*The Image component is a extension of the HTML img tag, and comes with automatic image optmization, such:*
- Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading
- Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport
- Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport)
- Serving images in modern formats (WebP and AVIF), when the browser supports it

*Important:*
It's a good practice to set the width and height of images to avoid layout shift, these should be an aspect ratio *identical* to the source image. These values are *not* the size image is rendered, but instead the size of the actual image file used to understanding the aspect ratio.

## Chapter 4: Creating Layouts and Pages

### Understanding Layout function

*This function defines a layout that will nest all pages in the directory where it is defined.*

*For example, it can be used in the app/dashboard to share a SideNav with all pages in this directory.*

### Understanding RootLayout function
*This function is **required** in every Next.js application, and any UI added to the root layout will be shared across **all** pages of the application.*

*It can be used to modify HTML and body tags, and add metadata.*

## Chapter 5: Navigating Between Pages

### Optimizing navigation

Instead of using an HTML tag to navigate between pages, use the Link component from next/link.

‚ùå Using the HTML component: the page always refreshes after a click;<br>
‚úÖ Using the Link component from next/link: navigate between the pages without seeing a full refresh.

*üí° To improve the navigation experience, Next.js automatically code splits your application by route segments. This is different from a traditional Reat SPA, where the browser loads all your application code on the initial load.*

## Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Database

### Deploying the project with Vercel
- Whenever you push changes to your **main** branch, Vercel will automatically redeploy your application with no configuration needed 
- When opening pull requests, you'll also have a instant preview URLs which allow to catch deployment errors early and share a preview of your project with the team members for feedback

### Lessons Learned
1. How to deploy a Project using Vercel;
2. How to connect with a PostgreSQL database;
3. Review of SQL commands, such as *CREATE TABLE* and *INSERT*, for creating tables and populating them based on *placeholder-data.ts* file.

**How to connect to a local PostgreSQL database: tutorial available [here](https://medium.com/@dekadekadeka/next-js-tutorial-with-local-database-quick-start-guide-394d48a0aada).**

## Chapter 7: Fetching Data

### Using Server Components to fetch data
By default, Next.jsapplications use React Server Components. These components are rendered on the server and sent to the client as static HTML. This is a relatively new approach, and there are several benefits to using them:

- Server Components *support JavaScript Promises, providing a solution for asynchronous tasks* like data fetching natively. You can use async/await syntax without needing to use useEffect, useState, or other data fetching libraries.

- Server Components *run on the server, allowing you to keep expensive data fetches and logic on the server, only sending the result to the client*.

- Since Server Components run on the server, *you can query the database directly without an additional API layer*. This saves you from writing and maintaining additional code.

*A Server Component was used to show the revenues in this chapter.*

### Understanding request waterfalls
*A ***waterfall** refers to a sequence of network requests that depend on the completion of previous requests. In the case of data fetching, each request can only begin once the previous request has returned data.*

For example, in *app/dashboard/page.tsx*:

```javascript
const revenue = await fetchRevenue();
const latestInvoices = await fetchLatestInvoices(); // wait for fetchRevenue() to finish
const {
  numberOfInvoices,
  numberOfCustomers,
  totalPaidInvoices,
  totalPendingInvoices,
} = await fetchCardData(); // wait for fetchLatestInvoices() to finish
```

This pattern in not necessarily bad. There may be cases where you *want waterfalls because you want a condition to be satisfied before you make the next request*. For example, you might want to fetch a user's ID and profile information first. Once you have the ID, you might the proceed to fetch their list of friends. In this case, each request is contingent on the data returned from the previous request.

*Warning*: This behavior can also be unintentional and impact performance!

### Understanding parallel data fetching
*A common way to avoid waterfalls is to initiate all data requests at the same time - in parallel.*

In JavaScript, you can use the *Promise.all()* or *Promise.allSettled()* functions to *initiate all promises at the same data*.

For example, in *app/lib/data.ts*, you used:
```javascript
    const data = await Promise.all([
      invoiceCountPromise,
      customerCountPromise,
      invoiceStatusPromise,
    ]);
```

Then, you can:
- Start executing all data fetches at the same time, which is faster than waiting for each request to complete in a waterfall;
- Use a native JavaScript pattern than can be applied to any library or framework.

However, there is one disadvantage of relying only on this JavaScript pattern: what happens if one data request is slower than all the others? Let's find out more in the next chapter.

## Chapter 8: Static and Dynamic Rendering

There are two limitations to the current setup:
- The data requests are creating an unintentional waterfall;
- The dashboard is static, so any data updates will bot be reflected on your application.

### Static Rendering
*With static rendering, data fetching and rendering happens on the server at **build time** (when you deploy) or when revalidating data.*

There are a couple of benefits of static rendering:
- Faster websites: prerendered content can be cached and globally served when deployed to platforms like Vercel;
- Reduced Server Load: because the content is cached, your server does not have to dynamically generate content for each user request;
- SEO: prerendered content is easier for seacrh engine crawlers to index, as the content is already when the page  loads.

Static rendering is useful for UI with *no data* or *data that is shared across users*, such as a static blog or a product page. It might **not be good fit for a dashboard** that has a **personalized data which is regularly updated**.

### Dynamic Rendering

*With dynamic rendering, content is rendering on the server for each user at **request time** (when the users visits the page).*

There are a couple of benefits of dynamic rendering:
- Real-Time Data: dynamic rendering allows your application to display real-time or frequently updated data. This is ideal for applications where data changes often;
- Use Specific Content: it's easier to serve personalized content, such as dashboards or user profiles, and update the data based on user interaction;
- Request Time Information: dynamic rendering allows you to access information that can only be known at request time, such as cookies or the URL search parameters.

*Adding an artificial 3-second delay to simulate a slow data fetch in the fetchRevenue function*, the results is that now your whole page is blocked from showing UI to the visitor while the data is being fetched. Which brings us to a common challenge developers have to solve:*

*With dynamic rendering, **your application is only as fast as your slower data fetch!***

## Chapter 9: Streaming
*In the previous chapter, we discussed how slow data fetches can impact the performance of your application. Let's look at how you can improve the user experience when there are a slow data requests.*

### What is streaming?
*Streaming is a data transfer technique that allows you to break down a route into smoller "chunks" and progressively stream them from the server to the client as they become ready.*

*By streaming, **you can prevent slow data requests from blocking your whole page**. This allows the user to see and interact with parts of the page without waiting for all the data to load before any UI can be shown to the user.*

**There are two ways implement streaming in Next.js:**
- At the page level, with the loading.tsx file (which creates *Suspenses* for you);
- At the component level, with *Suspense* for more granular control.

### Route Groups

*Route groups allows you to organize files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure. When you create a new folder using parentheses, the name won't be included in the URL path.*

*In this chapter you are using the route group **/dashboard/(overview)** to only apply loading.tsx to your dashboard overview page.*

/dashboard<br>
--(overview)<br>
---- loading.tsx<br>
---- page.tsx

The folder structure above allows you to only apply loading.tsx to yout dashboard overview page.

### Deciding where to place your Suspense boundaries
Where you place your Suspense boundaries will depend on a few things:
1. How you want the user experience the page as it streams;
2. What content you want to priorizatize;
3. If the components rely on data fetching.

*Where you place your suspense boundaries will vary depending on your application. In general, it's a **good practice to move your data fetches down to the components that need it, and the wrap those components in Suspense**. But there is nothing wrong with streaming the section or the whole page if that's what your application needs.

### Lessons Learned
- How to add a skeleton that shows a loader component when the fetching data is not ready.

## Chapter 10: Partial Prerendering

*Partial Prerendering is an experimental feature introduced in Next.js 14.*

*PPR is only available with the Next.js canary releases (next@canary), not in the stable version of Next.js. **We do not yet recommend using Partial Prerendering in production.***

To install the canary release of Next.js, run:
```
pnpm install next@canary
```

### Static vc. Dynamic Routes

For most web apps built today, you either choose between static and dynamic rendering for your *entire application*, or for a *specific route*. And in Next.js, *if you call a dynamic function in a route (like querying your database), the entire route becomes dynamic*.

However, most routes are not fully static or dynamic. For example, consider an ecommerce site. You might want to statically render the majority of the product information page, but you may want to fetch the user's cart and recommended products dinamically.

In our project, we can split the dashboard route as follows:
- Sidebar Navigation: static (doesn't rely on data is not personalized to the user)
- Sign Out Button: dynamic
- Cards: dynamic
- Recent Revenue Graph: dynamic
- Latest Invoices List: dynamic

### What is Partial Prerendering?
*Partial Prerendering is a new rendering model that allows you to combine the benefits of static and dynamic rendering in the same route.*

For example, if we have:
- Navbar (static)
- Product Information (static)
- Recommended Products (dynamic)
- Cart (dynamic)

When a user visits a route:
- A static route shell that includes NavBar and Product Information (static content) is served, ensuring a fast initial load;
- The shell leaves holes where dynamic content like the Cart and Recommended Products will load in asynchronously;
- The async holes are streamed in parallel, reducing the overall load time of the page.

You may not see a difference in your application in development, but you should notice a performance improvement in production. Next.js will prerender the static parts of your route and defer the dynamic parts until the user requests them.

*You can now revert these changes and move on to the next chapter.*

**To recap, you've done a few things to optimize data fetching in your application so far:**
1. Created a database in the same region as your application code to reduce latency between your server and database;
2. Fetched data on the server with React Server Components. This allows you to keep expensive data fetches and logic on the server, reduces the client-side JavaScript bundle, and prevents your database secrets from being exposed to the client;
3. Used SQL to only fetch the data you needed, reducing the amount of data transferred for each request and the amount of JavaScript needed to transform the data in memory;
4. Parallelize data fetching with JavaScript - where it made to do so;
5. Implemented Streaming to prevent slow data requests from blocking your whole page, and to allow the user to start interacting with the UI without waiting for everything to load;
6. Move data fetching down to the components that need it, thus isolation which parts of your routes should be dynamic.

## Chapter 11: Adding Search and Pagination

Inside */dashboard/invoices/page.tsx* some componenets will be added, such as:
1. Search: allows users to search for specific invoices;
2. Pagination: allows users to navigate between pages of invoices;
3. Table: displays the invoices.

**How it will work?**
The search funcionality will span the client and the server. When a user searches for an invoice on the client, the URL params will be updated, data will be fetched on the server, and the table will re-render on the server with new data.

### Why use URL search params?

URL search params will be used to manage the search state. There are a couple of benefits of implementing search with URL params:
- Bookmarkable and shareable URLs: since the search parameters are in the URL, users can bookmark the current state of the application, including their search queries and filters;
- Server-side rendering: URL parameters can be directly consumed on the server to render the initial state, making it easier to handle server rendering;
- Analytics and tracking: having search queries and filters directly in the URL makes it easier to track user behavior without requring additional client-side logic.

### Adding the search funcionality

These are the Next.js client hooks that you'll use to implement the search funcionality:
1. useSearchParams: allows you to access the parameters of the current URL. For example, the search params for this URL */dashboard/invoices?page=1&query=pending* would look like this: *{page: 1, query: pending}*;
2. usePathname: lets you read the current URL's pathname. For example, for the route */dashboard/invoices*, usePathname would return *'/dashboard/invoices'*;
3. useRouter: enables navigation between routes within client components programmatically.

**Here's a quick overview of the implementation steps:**
1. Capture the user's input;
2. Update the URL with the search params;
3. Keep the URL in sync with the input field;
4. Update the table to reflect the search query.

### When to use the useSearchParams() hook vs. the searchParams prop?

- Search is a *Client Component*, so you used the *useSearchParams() hook to access the params from the client*;
- Table ia a *Server Component that fetches its own data*, so you *can pass the searchParams prop from the page to the component*.

As a *general rule, if you want to read the parameters from the client, use useSearchParams() hook* as this avoids having to go back to the server.


*Important: You don't want to fetch data on the client as this would expose your database secrets (remember, you're not using an API layer). Instead, you can fetch the data on the server, and pass it to the component as a prop.*


## Chapter 12: Mutating Data

### What are Server Actions?
React Server Actions allow you to run asynchronous code directly on the server. They eliminate the need to create API endpoints to mutate your data. Instead, you write asynchronous functions that executes on the server and can be invoked from your Client or Server Components.

Secure is a top priority for web applications. This is where Server Actions come in. They include features like encrypted closures, strict input checks, error message hasing, host restrictions, and more - all working together to significantly enhance your application security.

### Using form with Server Actions
```javascript
// Server Component
export default function Page() {
  // Action
  async function create(formData: FormData) {
    'use server';
 
    // Logic to mutate data...
  }
 
  // Invoke the action using the "action" attribute
  return <form action={create}>...</form>;
}
```

**Here are the steps you'll take to create a new invoice:**
1. Create a form to capture the user's input;
2. Create a Server Action and invoke it from the form;
3. Inside your Server Action, extract the data from the *formData* object;
4. Validate and prepare the data to be inserted into your database;
5. Insert the data and handle any errors;
6. Revalidate the cache and redirect the user back to invoices page.

### Best practice about write Server Actions
*You can also write Server Actions directly inside Server Components by adding "use server" inside the action. But for this course, we'll keep them all organized in a separate file. We recommend having a separate file for your actions (such as /app/lib/actions.ts).*

### Create a Dynamic Route Segment

You can create dynamic route segments by *wrapping a folder's name in square brackets*. For example, *[id]*, *[post]* or *[slug]*.

/invoices<br>
-- [id]<br>
---- edit<br>
------ page.tsx<br>

The structure above allows you to access the route /dashboard/invoices/1/edit to update the data of the user with ID 1.

### Lessons Learned
1. Link a form to a Server Action (that creates an invoice);
2. Validate the data from form to alligns with the expected types in database using Zod (a TypeScript-first validation library);
3. How to get current time and convert it to a string;
4. How to create a dynamic route segment;
5. How to update a record in the database;
6. How to delete a record in the database.

## Chapter 13: Handling Errors

### Handling uncaught exceptions from the server

It can be handle adding the Error component to the directory. For example, in */app/dashboard/invoices/error.tsx* will catch uncaught exceptions to the invoices page.

### Handling 404 errors

*notFound* function can be used when you try to fetch a resource that doesn't exist.

*That's something to keep in mind, notFound will take precedence over error.tsx, so you can reach out for it when you want to handle more specific errors!*

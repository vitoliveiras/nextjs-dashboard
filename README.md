# Learn Next.js

## About Project

Financial dashboard that has:
1. A public home page;
2. A login page;
3. Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication;
4. The ability for users to add, edit and delete invoices.

PS.: The dashboard will also have an accompanying database, which you'll set up later.

By the end of the course, you'll have the essential skills needed to start building full-stack Next.js applications.

## Creating a new project

*Recommendation: using pnpm (faster and more efficient than npm or yarn)*

1. Installing pnpm:
```
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Creating a Next.js app
```
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm
```

This command uses create-next-app, a CLI tool that sets up a Next.js application for you. In the command above, you're also using the *--example* flag with the starter examplo for this course.

## Understanding the basic structure of the Next.js app

- **/app**: Contains all the routes, components and logic for you application, this is where you'll be mostly working from
- **/app/lib**: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions
- **/app/ui**: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these componenets for you
- **/public**: Contains al  the static assets for your application, such images
- **Config Files**: You'll also notice config files such as *next.config.ts* at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using *create-next-app*. You'll not need to modify them in this course.

## Running the development server

1. Install the project's package
```
pnpm i
```

2. Start the development server
```
pnpm dev
```
